    "description": "About Cartesia\n\nOur mission is to build the next generation of AI: ubiquitous, interactive intelligence that runs wherever you are. Today, not even the best models can continuously process and reason over a year-long stream of audio, video and text—1B text tokens, 10B audio tokens and 1T video tokens—let alone do this on-device.\n\nWe're pioneering the model architectures that will make this possible. Our founding team met as PhDs at the Stanford AI Lab, where we invented State Space Models or SSMs, a new primitive for training efficient, large-scale foundation models. Our team combines deep expertise in model innovation and systems engineering paired with a design-minded product engineering team to build and ship cutting edge models and experiences.\n\nWe're funded by leading investors at Index Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners, along with Factory, Conviction, A Star, General Catalyst, SV Angel, Databricks and others. We're fortunate to have the support of many amazing advisors, and 90+ angels across many industries, including the world's foremost experts in AI.\n\nAbout the Role\n\nWe’re opening our first ever office in India, and looking to hire for a Software Engineer to advance our mission of building real-time multimodal intelligence.\n\nWhat You'll Do\n• Design and build low latency, scalable, and reliable model inference and serving stack for our cutting edge SSM foundation models\n• Work closely with our research team and product engineers to translate cutting edge research into incredible products\n• Build highly parallel, high quality data processing and evaluation infrastructure for foundation model training\n• You'll have significant autonomy to shape our products and directly impact how cutting-edge AI is applied across various devices and applications.\n\nWhat You'll Bring\n\nGiven the scale and difficulty of problems we work on, we value strong engineering skills at Cartesia.\n• Strong engineering skills, comfortable navigating complex codebases and monorepos.\n• A minimum of 3-5 years of experience in software engineering, product engineering or ML platform engineering\n• An eye for craft and writing clean and maintainable code.\n• You're comfortable diving into new technologies and can quickly adapt your skills to our tech stack (Go and Python on the backend, Next.js for the frontend).\n• Experience building large-scale distributed systems with high demands on performance, reliability, and observability.\n• Technical leadership with the ability to execute and deliver zero-to-one results amidst ambiguity.\n• [bonus] Background in or experience working with machine learning and generative models.\n\nEven if you don’t meet every requirement above, we'd encourage you to apply.\n\nWhat We Offer\n\n🍽 Lunch, dinner and snacks at the office.\n\n🏥 Stipend to cover medical insurance\n\n🦖 Your own personal Yoshi.\n\nOur Culture\n\n🏢 We’re an in-person team based out of San Francisco. We love being in the office, hanging out together, and learning from each other every day.\n\n🚢 We ship fast. All of our work is novel and cutting edge, and execution speed is paramount. We have a high bar, and we don’t sacrifice quality or design along the way.\n\n🤝 We support each other. We have an open & inclusive culture that’s focused on giving everyone the resources they need to succeed.",
