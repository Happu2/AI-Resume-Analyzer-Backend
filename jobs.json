It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.\n\nTo achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.\n\nOur work culture is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.\n\nWhile many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.\n\nThe CXAI Engineering team is part of Coinbase’s Enterprise Applications and Architecture org and builds the customer-facing and internal CX experiences that connect the Help Center, chatbots (CBCB), and agent workflows. The team owns core web/app chat and Help Center surfaces, partnering closely with Conversation Design, CX, and ML/platform teams to deliver secure, compliant, and scalable AI-powered support. Our work improves the quality, latency, and measurability of automated and agent-assisted experiences—helping customers get answers faster while enabling agents to resolve cases more effectively.\n\nWe are hiring an IC4 Software Engineer (frontend-leaning full-stack) to help drive key CXAI initiatives across Help Center and Chat, including the CBCB chatbot UI redesign, response quality and latency improvements, and platformization efforts like a shared evaluation framework across Coinbase and vendor bots. This engineer will own end-to-end delivery of Help Center → Chat → Agent handoff flows, implement complex React/TypeScript UIs (streaming responses, citations, feedback/QA loops, guardrail and error states), and partner with backend/platform teams to define and integrate APIs, events, and metrics across systems. You’ll thrive here if you enjoy high ownership, shipping customer-impacting features, and building reliable AI-enabled products that are fast, measurable, and scalable.\n\nWhat you’ll be doing (ie. job duties):\n• Build and evolve customer support experiences across web surfaces, including Help Center, chat, and agent-facing tools, in close partnership with Product, Design, and cross-functional engineering teams.\n• Deliver end-to-end features from technical design through implementation, testing, launch, and iteration—balancing customer impact, delivery timelines, and long-term maintainability.\n• Implement modern, accessible, and performant frontend UI components (e.g., rich conversational interfaces, feedback and survey experiences, and stateful workflow screens).\n• Integrate AI/LLM-powered capabilities into user-facing products (e.g., streamed responses, retrieval-backed answers with citations, feedback collection, and safe fallback/guardrail experiences).\n• Define and integrate service APIs and contracts with partner teams, including events/metrics instrumentation, error handling patterns, and multi-locale considerations.\n• Improve product quality and performance by investigating bottlenecks, reducing latency, strengthening reliability, and enhancing observability (dashboards, alerts, logging).\n• Contribute to evaluation and measurement workflows by enabling feedback loops and instrumentation that supports quality scoring, experimentation, and iterative improvement of AI experiences.\n• Maintain a high engineering bar through code reviews, automated testing, security-minded development, and ongoing reduction of technical debt across shared systems and workflow\n\nWhat we look for in you (ie. job requirements):\n• 3+ years of experience in software engineering.\n• Proven expertise in designing, building, scaling, and maintaining production services, with a strong understanding of micro-services architecture.\n• Ability to write high-quality, well-tested code that meets customer needs.\n• Deep understanding of what high-quality code and software engineering processes look like, and the ability to foster an environment that promotes them.\n• Strong technical skills in system design and coding.\n• Passion for building an open financial system that unites the world.\n• Excellent written and verbal communication skills, with a preference for open and transparent cultural practices.\n\nNice to haves:\n• Experience navigating rapid company growth (e.g., from startup to mid-size).\n• Familiarity with GenAI frameworks/tools, Python, GoLang, Docker, Postgres, MongoDB.\n• Background in AI/LLM infrastructure is a strong plus.\n\nJob #: G2755\n\nPay Transparency Notice: The target annual base salary for this position can range as detailed below. Full time offers from Coinbase also include bonus eligibility + equity eligibility + benefits (including medical, dental, and vision).\n\nBase salary range shown. Total compensation also includes equity and bonus eligibility and benefits:\n₹4,408,400—₹4,408,400 INR\n\nPlease be advised that each candidate may submit a maximum of four applications within any 30-day period. We encourage you to carefully evaluate how your skills and interests align with Coinbase's roles before applying.\n\nCommitment to Equal Opportunity\n\nCoinbase is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer.
